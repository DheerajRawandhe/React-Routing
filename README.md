## React Routing
I created a simple React Router setup that includes navigation and multiple pages (Home, About, Login, and User). The Navbar is included on each page to allow users to navigate easily.

### Key Features :-
- Routing with react-router-dom
- Navbar Integration
The Navbar component is included in all routes.

### It Works :-
The app starts with RouterProvider, which loads the router configuration.
When a user visits /, they see the Home component.
/about shows the About page, and /login displays the Login page.

- Install dependencies :- npm install
- Start the development server :- npm run dev   

Routing with react-router-dom :- Uses createBrowserRouter and RouterProvider for route management.
